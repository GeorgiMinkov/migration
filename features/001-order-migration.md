# Order Migration Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation
- [x] Create new `OrderController` with REST endpoint `GET /api/orders/{id}`
- [x] Set up Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the new endpoint
- [x] Configure feature flag `useRest_order` in application properties
- [x] Set up monitoring and metrics for the new endpoint

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [x] Implement `OrderController` to delegate to existing RMI service
- [x] Create `OrderDto` class matching the RMI response structure
- [x] Add request/response logging for the new endpoint
- [x] Implement error handling and proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Add input validation for the order ID parameter

## Phase 3: Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for the new controller
- [x] Create integration tests comparing RMI vs REST responses
- [x] Test feature flag behavior (enabled/disabled states)
- [ ] Performance test the new endpoint to ensure it meets the 120ms P95 latency target
- [x] Security testing (input validation, authentication, etc.)

## Phase 4: Observability
- [x] Add distributed tracing for the new endpoint
- [x] Set up dashboards for monitoring:
  - Request rates
  - Error rates
  - Latency percentiles
- [ ] Configure alerts for error rates exceeding 0.1%

## Phase 5: Gradual Rollout
- [ ] Deploy to staging with feature flag disabled
- [ ] Enable feature flag for internal testing
- [ ] Monitor metrics for 7 days to ensure stability
- [ ] Gradually increase traffic percentage to the new endpoint
- [ ] Monitor for any regressions

## Phase 6: Validation and Cleanup
- [ ] Verify 95% of traffic is using the new REST endpoint
- [ ] Monitor for 30 days post-launch
- [ ] Schedule removal of legacy RMI method (T + 60 days)
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the new REST endpoint
- [ ] Remove feature flag after successful migration

## Phase 7: Post-Migration
- [ ] Clean up any temporary monitoring or test code
- [x] Update API documentation for external integrators
- [ ] Document any lessons learned for future migrations
- [ ] Celebrate successful migration!
